# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Just started learning to code so I will continue with the Free Code Camp course! Currently up to "Remove Classes from an element with jQuery"

**Thoughts:** I have been working through the course but feel like nothing is sticking! hopefully the consistent nature of this challenge will help with that.

### Day 2: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the front end tutorials on free code camp and JUMPED into my first project - Tribute Page! 

**Thoughts:** I was amazed that when I started to work on this project how much of the content of the tutorials had sunk into cob web ridden corners of my mind! So stoked that I built this! Feeling like a Wizard right now!
