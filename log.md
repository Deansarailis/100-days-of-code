# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Just started learning to code so I will continue with the Free Code Camp course! Currently up to "Remove Classes from an element with jQuery"

**Thoughts:** I have been working through the course but feel like nothing is sticking! hopefully the consistent nature of this challenge will help with that.
